## Task-Master Integration Checklist

Before feeding requirements into task-master:

1. [ ] All business requirements are clearly defined
2. [ ] Technical architecture is documented
3. [ ] Component boundaries are established
4. [ ] Dependencies are identified
5. [ ] Quality gates are defined
6. [ ] Timeline milestones are set
7. [ ] Resource constraints are documented
8. [ ] Success criteria are established

## Next Steps

1. Complete this questionnaire with stakeholders
2. Document all decisions in ADRs
3. Create initial architecture diagram
4. Define component boundaries
5. Feed requirements into task-master
6. Generate task breakdown
7. Review and adjust tasks
8. Begin implementation

## Notes
- Document all assumptions
- Note any risks or concerns
- Record any decisions made
- Track open questions
