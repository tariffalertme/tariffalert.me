# TariffAlert.me Project Framework

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. **Architectural Planning**
   - Started with task-based approach without proper architectural foundation
   - Lacked clear technical boundaries and component relationships
   - No defined deployment strategy from the beginning

2. **Development Process**
   - Reactive troubleshooting instead of proactive design
   - Feature changes without proper impact assessment
   - Inconsistent component development standards
   - Missing automated testing strategy

3. **Project Management**
   - Over-reliance on task decomposition without strategic overview
   - Insufficient tracking of technical debt
   - No clear feature prioritization framework
   - Missing quality gates and acceptance criteria
