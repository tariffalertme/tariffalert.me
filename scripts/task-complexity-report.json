      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Foundation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js 14 project setup task into specific subtasks covering initialization, configuration of TypeScript and TailwindCSS, Supabase integration, project structure setup, environment configuration, and repository management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Supabase) and requires setting up the entire foundation for the project. While each individual component is relatively straightforward, coordinating all these technologies together increases complexity."

      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Database Schema",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database schema implementation task into specific subtasks covering table creation, relationships setup, indexing, security policies, and migration management for the news items, products, categories, and price history data models.",
      "reasoning": "Database schema design requires careful planning to ensure proper relationships, indexing, and security. The time-series structure for price history adds complexity, as does implementing row-level security and database triggers."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop News Aggregation System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the news aggregation system development into specific subtasks covering API client implementation for government sources, news APIs, and Twitter, data normalization, caching system, scheduling, filtering, and database storage.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity due to the integration with multiple external APIs (government sources, news APIs, Twitter), data normalization across different formats, implementing caching, scheduling, and filtering systems. Each integration point introduces potential issues."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Build Product Directory and E-commerce Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the product directory and e-commerce integration task into specific subtasks covering API client implementation for e-commerce platforms, data normalization, affiliate link generation, product categorization, country detection, database storage, search functionality, and price tracking.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating with multiple e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Walmart, Target) is complex and requires handling different data formats. The task also includes building several systems (normalization, categorization, affiliate tracking, price history) that work together."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Core Frontend UI Components",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the frontend UI components development task into specific subtasks covering responsive layout implementation, navigation components, news display components, product listing components, filtering UI, Twitter feed component, and chart implementation.",
      "reasoning": "Building a comprehensive UI component library requires attention to detail, responsiveness, and consistent design. The integration of Chart.js for visualizations and ensuring mobile responsiveness adds complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication and Profiles",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the user authentication and profiles implementation task into specific subtasks covering Supabase authentication configuration, user profile schema, registration/login flows, profile management UI, saved products functionality, notification systems, and session management.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication systems require careful implementation for security. While Supabase simplifies some aspects, the task still involves multiple components like social logins, profile management, saved products, and notification preferences."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Data Visualization and Price History",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the data visualization and price history task into specific subtasks covering price data collection enhancement, time-series storage optimization, Chart.js visualizations, price comparison features, prediction algorithms, and interactive controls.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex data processing, storage optimization for time-series data, and creating advanced interactive visualizations. The price prediction algorithms based on tariff impacts add significant complexity."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement AI-Powered Content Generation",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the AI-powered content generation task into specific subtasks covering OpenAI API integration, template creation, recommendation algorithms, impact analysis generation, trend analysis, automated categorization, and content validation/scheduling.",
      "reasoning": "AI integration is inherently complex, requiring careful prompt engineering and result validation. This task involves multiple AI-powered features (blog posts, recommendations, impact analysis) and includes algorithms for trend analysis and content personalization."
    },

      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Build Advanced Search and Filtering",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the advanced search and filtering task into specific subtasks covering Elasticsearch implementation, faceted search, filtering systems, trend-based filtering, sorting options, saved searches, analytics, and relevance scoring.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing Elasticsearch and creating a comprehensive search system with faceted search, multiple filtering options, and relevance scoring is technically challenging. The integration with the existing product and news data adds complexity."
