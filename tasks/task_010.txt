# Task ID: 10
# Title: Optimize Performance and Deploy MVP
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Perform final optimizations, testing, and deploy the Minimum Viable Product
# Details:
Implement Redis caching for API responses. Optimize database queries with proper indexing. Set up Cloudflare CDN for static assets. Configure serverless functions for background tasks. Implement image optimization pipeline. Set up monitoring and alerting. Create CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment. Perform load testing and optimize bottlenecks. Implement error tracking and reporting. Configure analytics for user behavior tracking. Create documentation for API endpoints and components.

# Test Strategy:
Measure performance improvements with benchmarking tools. Verify caching reduces response times. Test CDN configuration with global requests. Validate serverless function execution. Measure image loading performance. Test monitoring alerts with simulated issues. Verify CI/CD pipeline with test deployments. Conduct load testing with simulated traffic. Test error tracking with forced errors. Confirm analytics data collection. Review documentation for completeness.

4. Implement cache busting strategy for versioned assets
5. Create an image optimization pipeline using tools like Sharp or Imagemin
6. Set up automated WebP conversion for modern browsers with fallbacks
7. Implement responsive images with srcset and size attributes
8. Configure lazy loading for below-the-fold images
9. Minify and bundle JavaScript and CSS files
10. Testing: Use Lighthouse or WebPageTest to measure performance improvements and verify assets are being served from CDN

## 3. Set Up Serverless Functions and Background Processing [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Configure serverless functions for background tasks to handle resource-intensive operations asynchronously, improving application responsiveness and scalability.
### Details:
1. Identify CPU-intensive or time-consuming operations suitable for background processing
2. Set up serverless infrastructure using AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, or similar platform
3. Implement serverless functions for image processing, data exports, and email sending
4. Create a message queue system for reliable task processing (e.g., SQS, RabbitMQ)
5. Implement retry logic and dead-letter queues for failed operations
6. Set up event triggers for scheduled tasks and database changes
7. Create API endpoints to check background task status
8. Implement webhook capabilities for third-party integrations
9. Configure appropriate timeout and memory allocation for serverless functions
10. Testing: Verify background tasks execute correctly by monitoring task completion and checking for error conditions

## 4. Implement Monitoring, Error Tracking, and Analytics [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Set up comprehensive monitoring, error tracking, and analytics to gain insights into application performance, identify issues quickly, and understand user behavior.
### Details:
1. Set up application performance monitoring (APM) using New Relic, Datadog, or similar tool
2. Configure server and infrastructure monitoring for CPU, memory, and disk usage
3. Implement error tracking with Sentry or similar service to capture and categorize errors
4. Set up alerting thresholds and notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)
5. Create custom dashboards for key performance metrics
6. Implement structured logging with appropriate log levels
7. Configure analytics tracking for user behavior using Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or similar
8. Set up event tracking for key user actions and conversion funnels
9. Implement custom metrics for business KPIs
10. Testing: Verify alerts trigger correctly for simulated error conditions and confirm analytics events are being captured accurately

## 5. Create CI/CD Pipeline and Deploy MVP [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Implement a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline, perform load testing, optimize bottlenecks, and deploy the MVP to production with proper documentation.
### Details:
1. Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Jenkins
2. Configure automated testing for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
3. Implement code quality checks and security scanning
4. Create staging and production environments with infrastructure-as-code
5. Configure blue-green deployment strategy to minimize downtime
6. Perform load testing using tools like k6, JMeter, or Locust
7. Identify and optimize performance bottlenecks revealed during load testing
