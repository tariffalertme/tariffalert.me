# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Data Visualization and Price History
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive price history tracking and visualization components
# Details:
Enhance price history data collection from multiple sources. Implement time-series data storage optimization. Create advanced Chart.js visualizations for price trends. Develop price comparison across retailers. Build price prediction algorithms based on tariff impacts. Implement interactive chart controls. Create data export functionality. Design visual indicators for price impacts. Develop historical price range indicators.

# Test Strategy:
Test data collection from multiple sources. Verify time-series data storage and retrieval. Validate chart rendering with different data patterns. Test retailer comparison accuracy. Evaluate prediction algorithm accuracy with historical data. Test interactive controls. Verify data export formats. Confirm visual indicators accurately reflect data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Enhance Price Data Collection and Storage System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a robust system for collecting price data from multiple sources and optimize time-series data storage
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create data fetchers for multiple retail APIs (Amazon, Walmart, Target, etc.)
2. Implement a standardized data format to normalize price data from different sources
3. Design and implement a time-series database schema optimized for price history storage
4. Create data indexing for efficient retrieval by time ranges, products, and retailers
5. Implement data validation and cleaning processes
6. Set up scheduled jobs for regular price data collection
7. Add logging and monitoring for data collection processes

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for each data fetcher
- Integration tests for the data normalization pipeline
- Performance tests for data storage and retrieval operations
- End-to-end tests for the complete data collection workflow

## 2. Build Chart.js Visualization Components [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create reusable Chart.js visualization components for displaying price trends and historical data
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Set up Chart.js integration with the application framework
2. Create a base chart component with common configuration options
3. Implement specialized chart types for different price visualizations:
   - Line charts for price trends over time
   - Bar charts for price comparisons across retailers
   - Candlestick charts for price ranges (high/low/average)
4. Add responsive design features to charts for different screen sizes
5. Implement color schemes and styling consistent with application design
6. Create chart legends and tooltips with detailed price information
7. Optimize chart rendering performance for large datasets

Testing approach:
- Visual regression tests for chart components
- Unit tests for chart data transformations
- Browser compatibility tests
- Performance tests with large datasets

## 3. Develop Interactive Chart Controls and Data Export [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Implement interactive controls for chart manipulation and functionality to export price history data
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create time range selectors (day, week, month, year, custom)
2. Implement zoom and pan functionality for detailed exploration
3. Add filters for specific retailers or product categories
4. Create toggles for different visualization modes
5. Implement data point highlighting and selection
6. Build data export functionality in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)
7. Create shareable chart URLs with preserved settings
8. Implement print-friendly chart views
9. Add visual indicators for significant price changes

Testing approach:
- User interaction tests for all controls
- Validation of exported data formats
- Cross-browser testing of interactive features
- Accessibility testing for all interactive elements

## 4. Implement Price Comparison and Prediction Features [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Develop advanced price comparison across retailers and prediction algorithms based on historical data and tariff impacts
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create side-by-side retailer price comparison views
2. Implement percentage difference calculations and visualizations
3. Develop historical price range indicators (lowest/highest/average)
4. Build a price prediction model using historical data patterns
5. Integrate tariff impact data into the prediction algorithm
6. Create visual indicators for predicted price trends
7. Implement confidence intervals for predictions
8. Add alerts for significant predicted price changes
9. Create A/B testing framework to evaluate prediction accuracy

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for comparison and prediction algorithms
- Validation against historical data for prediction accuracy
- Performance testing of prediction algorithms
- User testing of comparison features and prediction visualizations
- Automated regression tests for the complete feature set
