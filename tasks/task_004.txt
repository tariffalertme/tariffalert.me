# Task ID: 4
# Title: Build Product Directory and E-commerce Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the product directory system and integrate with major e-commerce platforms
# Details:
Implement API clients for e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Walmart, Target). Create product data normalization system. Develop affiliate link generation and tracking. Build product categorization system based on tariff impacts. Implement country of origin detection. Create product storage and update system in the database. Set up basic search functionality for products. Implement price tracking system to record historical prices.

Test e-commerce API integrations with sample products. Verify normalization across different platforms. Confirm affiliate link generation and tracking. Test categorization with sample products. Validate country detection accuracy. Verify database storage and retrieval. Test search functionality with various queries. Verify price history recording over time.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement E-commerce Platform API Clients [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop API client modules for Amazon, Walmart, and Target to fetch product data, pricing, and availability information
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a base API client interface with common methods for product fetching
2. Implement Amazon Product Advertising API client with authentication and rate limiting
3. Implement Walmart Open API client with proper error handling
4. Implement Target API client (or scraping alternative if no public API is available)
5. Add logging for all API interactions
6. Create unit tests for each client using mock responses
7. Document API limitations and rate limits for each platform

Testing approach:
- Unit test each client with mock responses
- Integration tests with sandbox environments where available
- Test error handling and rate limiting functionality

## 2. Build Product Data Normalization System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a system to normalize and standardize product data from different e-commerce platforms into a consistent format
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Define a standard product data model with common fields (name, price, description, images, etc.)
2. Create platform-specific adapters to transform API responses to the standard model
3. Implement validation rules for required fields and data quality
4. Build country of origin detection using product descriptions and metadata
5. Create normalization pipelines for batch processing
6. Add data cleansing for inconsistent formatting (units, sizes, etc.)
7. Implement caching strategy for normalized data

Testing approach:
- Unit test each adapter with sample API responses
- Test with edge cases (missing fields, unusual formats)
- Validate normalized outputs match expected schema
- Benchmark performance with large datasets

## 3. Develop Product Storage and Database Schema [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Design and implement the database schema and storage system for products with update mechanisms
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design database schema for products with all required fields
2. Implement database migrations for the product tables
3. Create data access layer with CRUD operations
4. Build update mechanism to refresh product data periodically
5. Implement price tracking system to record historical prices
6. Add database indexes for optimized queries
7. Create backup and recovery procedures
8. Implement data versioning for product changes

Testing approach:
- Unit test CRUD operations
- Test price history tracking with sample data
- Performance testing for bulk operations
- Verify update mechanisms with simulated changes
- Test database indexes with large datasets

## 4. Implement Product Categorization and Tariff Impact System [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Build a system to categorize products and determine tariff impacts based on product data and country of origin
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create product category taxonomy aligned with tariff codes
2. Implement categorization algorithm using product metadata
3. Build tariff calculation system based on country of origin
4. Create admin interface for manual category adjustments
5. Implement batch categorization for new products
6. Add tariff impact visualization for products
7. Create category-based navigation system
8. Build reporting for tariff impact by category

Testing approach:
- Test categorization accuracy with sample products
- Validate tariff calculations against known rates
- Test edge cases with products spanning multiple categories
- Performance testing for batch categorization
- Usability testing of admin interface

## 5. Build Affiliate Link Generation and Search Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Implement affiliate link generation, tracking system, and search functionality for the product directory
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Integrate with affiliate programs for each e-commerce platform
2. Create affiliate link generation service with tracking parameters
3. Implement click tracking and attribution system
4. Build basic search functionality with filters
5. Add relevance ranking for search results
6. Implement faceted search by category, price range, etc.
7. Create product recommendation engine based on tariff impact
8. Build analytics dashboard for affiliate performance

Testing approach:
- Verify affiliate links generate correctly for each platform
- Test click tracking with simulated user interactions
- Validate search results for accuracy and relevance
- Performance testing for search with large product catalog
- A/B testing for search result ranking algorithms
