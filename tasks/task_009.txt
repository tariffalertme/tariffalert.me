# Task ID: 9
# Title: Build Advanced Search and Filtering
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement comprehensive search, filtering, and sorting capabilities for products and news
# Details:
Implement Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities. Create faceted search for product attributes. Develop filtering by country, category, and price impact. Implement trend-based filtering (BPA-free, organic, etc.). Build sorting options with multiple parameters. Create saved search functionality. Implement search analytics to improve results. Develop type-ahead suggestions. Create search result highlighting. Implement relevance scoring based on tariff impacts.

# Test Strategy:
Test Elasticsearch integration with complex queries. Verify faceted search with multiple attributes. Test filtering combinations for expected results. Validate trend-based filtering accuracy. Test sorting with different parameters. Verify saved search functionality. Analyze search analytics data. Test type-ahead suggestions response time. Verify result highlighting. Evaluate relevance scoring with test queries.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Elasticsearch Core Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and integrate Elasticsearch with the application to enable advanced search capabilities for products and news
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Install and configure Elasticsearch server
2. Create index mappings for products and news data
3. Implement data synchronization between database and Elasticsearch
4. Build basic search API endpoints that connect to Elasticsearch
5. Implement relevance scoring configuration based on tariff impacts
6. Set up search result highlighting for matched terms
7. Create reusable search service layer for future extensions

Testing approach:
- Verify Elasticsearch connection and proper indexing
- Test basic search functionality with various queries
- Validate that indexed data matches the database
- Benchmark search performance and response times

## 2. Develop Faceted Search and Filtering System [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement faceted search capabilities for product attributes and core filtering functionality by country, category, and price impact
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Extend Elasticsearch mappings to support faceted search
2. Implement aggregations for product attributes (category, country, price range)
3. Create filter components in the UI for each facet type
4. Build API endpoints that support filtering by multiple parameters
5. Implement price impact range filtering with min/max values
6. Develop country-specific filtering with geo-location awareness
7. Add category hierarchy filtering with parent-child relationships

Testing approach:
- Test each filter type independently and in combination
- Verify facet counts match actual result counts
- Test edge cases like empty result sets
- Validate filter persistence across search sessions

## 3. Build Trend-Based Filtering and Sorting Options [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement specialized filtering for product trends (BPA-free, organic, etc.) and comprehensive sorting capabilities with multiple parameters
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Define and implement trend-based attributes in Elasticsearch (BPA-free, organic, sustainable, etc.)
2. Create specialized filters for trend attributes with appropriate UI components
3. Implement multi-parameter sorting logic (relevance, price, date, impact level)
4. Build sort direction toggles (ascending/descending)
5. Create compound sorting with primary and secondary sort parameters
6. Implement default sorting rules based on user context
7. Add sorting persistence across search sessions

Testing approach:
- Verify trend filters correctly include/exclude products
- Test sorting with various parameters and directions
- Validate compound sorting works correctly
- Test performance with large result sets and complex sorting

## 4. Implement Advanced Search Features and Analytics [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Add user-focused advanced search features including saved searches, type-ahead suggestions, and search analytics
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create saved search functionality with user accounts integration
2. Implement CRUD operations for saved searches
3. Build type-ahead suggestion system using Elasticsearch completion suggester
4. Implement search term analytics collection and storage
5. Create admin dashboard for viewing popular searches and zero-result searches
6. Implement search improvement algorithms based on analytics
7. Add personalized search results based on user history (if available)

Testing approach:
- Test saved search functionality with various user scenarios
- Verify type-ahead suggestions work with partial inputs
- Validate analytics data is correctly collected and stored
- Test search improvements based on collected analytics
