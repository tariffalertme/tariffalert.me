# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate OpenAI API for Content Generation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the connection to OpenAI's API and implement the core service for generating text content based on different prompts and templates.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create an API service class to handle communication with OpenAI
2. Implement authentication and API key management with proper security
3. Create a content generation service with methods for different types of content (blog posts, product descriptions, impact analysis)
4. Implement prompt engineering techniques with templating system
5. Add error handling, rate limiting, and retry logic
6. Create a caching mechanism to avoid redundant API calls

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for API connection and response handling
- Integration tests with mock responses
- Test different prompt structures and evaluate output quality

## 2. Develop Templates and Generation System for Tariff Blog Posts [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a template-based system for generating blog posts about tariff changes and their impacts on different industries and products.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a schema for blog post templates with placeholders for tariff data
2. Create at least 5 different blog post templates for various scenarios (tariff increases, decreases, new regulations)
3. Implement a template selection algorithm based on the tariff data context
4. Develop a system to inject relevant tariff data, statistics, and examples into templates
5. Build a post-processing system to ensure coherence and readability
6. Implement a review workflow for generated content before publishing

Testing approach:
- Validate generated blog posts against quality criteria
- Test with various tariff scenarios to ensure appropriate template selection
- Perform readability and grammar checks on generated content

## 3. Implement Product Recommendation and Categorization System [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop algorithms to automatically categorize products and generate relevant product recommendations based on tariff data and user interests.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a product categorization system using AI classification
2. Implement automated tagging of products based on descriptions and tariff codes
3. Create a recommendation engine that considers tariff impacts on product pricing
4. Develop algorithms to identify substitute products in case of high tariffs
5. Implement user interest tracking to personalize recommendations
6. Build an API endpoint to serve recommendations to the frontend

Testing approach:
- Evaluate categorization accuracy against manually categorized products
- Test recommendation relevance with different user profiles
- Benchmark performance with large product datasets
- A/B test different recommendation algorithms

## 4. Build Country-Specific Impact Analysis Generation [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create a system that generates detailed analyses of how tariff changes impact specific countries, industries, and trade relationships.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Develop data models to represent country-specific tariff impacts
2. Implement algorithms to calculate financial impact of tariff changes on trade between countries
3. Create visualization data generation for charts and graphs
4. Build natural language generation for impact summaries and key insights
5. Implement comparative analysis between different countries
6. Develop historical trend integration to provide context for current changes

Testing approach:
- Validate calculations against known economic models
- Test with historical tariff change data to verify accuracy
- Review generated analyses with domain experts
- Test performance with large datasets covering multiple countries

## 5. Develop Content Validation, Scheduling and Publishing System [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Create a system to validate generated content quality, schedule content publication, and manage the content lifecycle.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement content quality validation using NLP techniques (coherence, readability, factual consistency)
2. Create a content approval workflow with human-in-the-loop validation
3. Develop a scheduling system for timed content publication
4. Build analytics integration to track content performance
5. Implement feedback loop to improve future content generation
6. Create a content management interface for administrators

Testing approach:
- Validate quality checks against expert-written content
- Test scheduling system with various time zones and publication rules
- Perform user acceptance testing on the admin interface
- Test integration with publishing platforms and social media
